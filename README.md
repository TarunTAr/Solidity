# Blockchain_Course
This course was designed about some basic concepts about Web3 and Blockchain with the solidity programming. 
I got a project at the end of this course.

## Project Overview
I have a Project to create contract. In that I created a contract name as MyToken where token name as "light" and token abbreviation as "bulb" along with its total supply set to be zero. If I want to mint some amount of bat tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it and vice versa with burn the token 

### Project Operation 

* I used Online Remix IDE compiler for writing the solidity code Program with a version (0.8.18)
* I created a file which is in the repository named as token.sol .

### Run it
* Create a folder give a name as token.sol (in my case).
* You simply compile the code.
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract.
* And after deploying the code , you have to enter certain inputs.
